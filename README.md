# Billboard: A personalized music trivia experience.

## What is Billboard?
Billboard is a music trivia game that quizzes a user on their own music taste. A player will log into their Spotify account before starting the game, so each question can be created with personalized data using Spotify's Web API. Each round consists of ten multiple choice questions complete with a results page giving more information.

## Who are we?
Billboard was created by Team Bill, a group of 7 people, for the Husky Coding Project at the University of Washington, Seattle. We began this project with litle knowledge of making a full web app from start to end, and, over the course of a year, created this website!

*Special thanks to those in Husky Coding Project who supported us along the way. :)*
